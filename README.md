# COVID-19-Statistical-and-Time-Series-Analysis
COVID-19, a novel coronavirus, is currently a major worldwide threat. It has infected more than five million people globally leading to thousands of deaths. In such grave circumstances, it is very important to predict the future infected cases to support the prevention of the disease and aid in the healthcare service preparation. Following that notion, we have developed a model and then employed it for time-series analysis of COVID-19 cases in India. The study indicates an ascending trend for the cases in the coming days. A time-series analysis also presents an exponential increase in the number of cases.
In this post, an overview of the current Coronavirus situation in India has been represented with data that has been crowdsourced and also taken from the repositories of https://www.covid19india.org/. A big thanks to them for providing these data.
